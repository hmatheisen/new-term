#+TITLE: New Term Window
#+AUTHOR: Henry MATHEISEN

A script to open a new horizontal terminal window in one command.

** How to install it

   #+BEGIN_SRC bash
   git clone https://github.com/hmatheisen/new-term
   #+END_SRC

   This package is not on MELPA since there already is one similar,
   but I didn't like it so I made a new one :)

** How to use it

   In order to use, it, you simply need to bind the a key to the
   =toggle-term-window=

   Then you can map the utilities functions to the =term-raw-map= so it
   does not interfere with other commands but only the ones in =Term mode=.

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
   (require 'new-term)

   ;; Set the term toggle as a global command
   (global-set-key (kbd "C-x t") 'toggle-term-window)

   ;; Set the other utilities in in the command map
   (define-key term-raw-map (kbd "C-c <up>") 'bigger-term-window)
   (define-key term-raw-map (kbd "C-c <down>") 'smaller-term-window)
   (define-key term-raw-map (kbd "C-c q") 'quit-term)
   #+END_SRC

   Or if you use =use-package=:

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
   (use-package new-term
   :init
   (global-set-key (kbd "C-x t") 'toggle-term-window)
   (define-key term-raw-map (kbd "C-c <up>") 'bigger-term-window)
   (define-key term-raw-map (kbd "C-c <down>") 'smaller-term-window)
   (define-key term-raw-map (kbd "C-c q") 'quit-term))
   #+END_SRC
